# PokéTeam Builder

PokéTeam Builder is a small front-end project where users can search Pokémon data and build their own team using live data from the PokeAPI.

The goal of this project was to practice working with external APIs, user interaction, and client-side data storage.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a simple but interactive project that shows I can:
- Work with a real external API
- Handle asynchronous data using fetch
- Manage user interactions on the front end
- Store and reuse data on the client side
- Build something that people can actually click and use
